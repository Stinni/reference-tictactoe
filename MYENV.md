# My Environment

### Laptop:
* Dell Inspiron
* Intel Core i7 (Sandy Bridge) 2 GHz
* 8 GB DDR3
* 256 GB SSD drive
* Windows 10

### Desktop:
* Intel Core i5 (Haswell) 3.4 GHz
* 16 GB DDR3
* 256 GB SSD drive for the OS, 3 x 500 GB HD's RAID-ed together to make one 1 TB disk and then a 3 TB disk.
* Windows 8.1 (due to the RAID being done with MS storage spaces I haven't risked updating to Windows 10 yet)

### PS.
I've done all school projects on both computers (Git helps with that a lot).
I tried using Windows for the TicTacToe project but after the second day I set up a Ubuntu 14.04 virtual machine.
I've used that same VM on both computers since.

# Who am I ?

### Name
My name is Kristinn Heiðar Freysteinsson

### Where you grew up
I grew up in Breiðholt, Reykjavík city. :) I now live in Grafarvogur with my wife and we travel
couple of times a year to where she's from in the north of Ireland.

### Education
After finishing school (Seljaskóli) in 1997 I went to Verzlunarskóli Íslands and did 5 years there but didn't finish.
I thought that I'd had enough of school but started doing online studying at the same college in 2006 I think.
I graduated from Versló in 2012 and that same year I studied at NTV (CompTIA A+, Network+, MCTS and MCITP).
I didn't finish those certifications though because I got into the University of Reykjavík at that time and decided to spend my time on a BSc degree.

### Employment history
I've worked at construction sites when I was 16-19 during the summers. I worked for 6 years at 2 of Húsasmiðjan's warehouses, doing various jobs.
The last jobs I worked there were as a shift supervisor and then as a logistics manager and helping with managing the warehouse.
I then worked as a security guard at Smáralind for about 6 years but I spent most of my time at the 'control station' in front of a computer.
The main control station for Öryggismiðstöð Íslands was in Smáralind at that time and I did a bit of work there aswell.
The last year and a half I worked for ÖMÍ I was in their offices, answering phones and doing other customer service related jobs, along with a bit of
tech support.
Last 2 summers I spent working for Bakkinn (warehouse work again) and then Mannvirkjastofnun (packing up old files and answering phones).

### What kind of software person are you?
I actually don't know yet. I still like everything I've been studying enough to not be exactly sure. But I think I'm leaning more towards actual coding
(as opposed to the theoretical, academic or the more customer related jobs), software architect or something similar. I like solving problems and I'd like
to look into f.ex. OS programming, networking and so on...

### What do you expect go get out of this course?
A lot! :) I really like the word practical (hagnýt). The course is a part of 'Vef- og viðmótsþróun'
http://www.ru.is/media/td/Vef-og-vidmotsthrounI.pdf
so besides that, I really liked the software engineering course and I thought this'd be quite practical too.
I've taken quite a few courses but I've still not seen any delivery of software (that I remember) so I'm hoping to maybe see how that's done.
